<h4 id="why-even-write-this-post">Why even write this post?</h4>
<p>Generally, I want to get this post out there to the masses as a blanket introduction of who I am, what I do, and what I want to do. I want this to serve as an introductory “Hello” from the imaginary office water fountain in my living room. I want to invite you into my life and hold no reservations about anything. I feel that the best quality of life can only be achieved through up front honesty and empathy. I have found that there can be no inner peace and self-satisfaction with my life, should I attempt to play any games, systems, or politics. So, in carrying that mantra forward in this post, I hope that by the end you achieve a clear and concise picture of Jake Champlin.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="where-to-begin">Where to begin</h3>
<p>First of all, computers have always fascinated me. Scratch that. Empowered me. Given that I was born in one of the first “fortunate” generations of tech-ies, the first computer I ever got to play with was an old IBM PC-350 that had a whopping 1.6GB hard drive, 64MB of RAM, and 4MB of video memory. The mouse weighed a ton, the keyboard was an IBM Model-M, and the resolution would cause blindness by today’s standards, but I loved it. [I honestly loved the springs of the IBM Model-M, and they are mainly the reason I have Cherry MX-Blues in my mechanical keyboard today].My father had recently purchased a slew of 5 1/4” floppy disks of Commander Keen IV, Wolfenstein, and Doom. I was hooked. It didn’t matter that the machine ran horribly slow, or clunky. I was six years old, playing around in MS-DOS to enable God Mode in Wolfenstein. I quickly crashed the beloved IBM though, as playing around in DOS reading all of the HELP pages (I really hate MS-DOS’s internal documenting compared to UNIX) by deleting the entire C:&gt; drive with a single command. </p>

<p>From there my love for video games and mainly everything that John Carmack had created, I loved. Halo LAN parties during high school, World of Warcraft and Diablo binges were routine in my high school career. Drinking nearly lethal amounts of B.A.W.L.S. and staying up for the whole weekend to beat an entire game in one sitting was not uncommon for us. And I loved everything about it. </p>

<h3 id="getting-into-trouble-and-growing-from-it">Getting into trouble and growing from it</h3>
<p>I really <em>have</em> to thank my parents looking back, being honest and all. Without being constantly grounded from various electronic devices and locked out of all of our networking equipment I doubt I would have ever learned how a firewall works, or how to reset and reconfigure a router. Getting around my father’s security implementations was often more fun than the end goal. I learned how to capture packets of traffic, spoof the mac address of our router, and bypass all content filtering enabled at home. </p>

<p>By the time I had left high school I had: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Migrated fully to Linux.</li>
  <li>Hacked my iPod Classic to run Linux [So I could play DOOM of course].</li>
  <li>Hacked my PSP to gain access to a wireless web browser before the firmware allowed it. (This was really cool actually. Done via a DNS change in a networked game). </li>
  <li>Two years of AP Java Programming classes.</li>
  <li>Competed in Science Olympiad contests where I programmed and built a mechanical robot. </li>
  <li>Built my own gaming computer.</li>
  <li>Multiple instances of “breaking” our home networking equipment to gain access to the internet. (Which I was <em>always</em> grounded from).</li>
  <li>Learned networking hardware proficiently. Cable termination, Punch Down Blocks, Configuring Enterprise Switches / Routers, etc…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="college">College</h3>
<p>I attended the University of Kentucky for Electrical Engineering. Ugh, I hate even typing that out. I really did not like the circuitry courses and Chemistry. Oh man, I <em>really</em> hated my chemistry classes. I loved the programming classes though. I maintained very high marks in both semesters of C++ programming. I left UK after 1.5 years, and decided to work full time in the food industry. While this was not the smartest choice I have ever made, it sure did make me realize a lot about where I wanted my future to go. </p>

<hr />

<h3 id="beginning-my-professional-career">Beginning my professional career</h3>
<p>After working full time and living in Lexington, KY for three years I decided to come back home to Columbus, Indiana. I wanted to give school another shot, and decided the local community college in town would be a great place to save money and learn the skills that I would need to escalate my professional career. 
I got a job at a local computer repair store and that <em>really</em> sparked my childhood interests in computers. Why I didn’t choose Computer Science as my major at UK, I can’t tell you. I don’t understand it either, honestly. </p>

<h4 id="development-career">Development Career</h4>
<p>While working at the local computer repair store I found a full time developer position at a local engineering firm. While the company took a huge risk in hiring me, they could see my potential and hunger to learn. The engineering company was a great first job. They allowed me the freedom to learn and grow at my own pace, while still teaching me the in’s and out’s of software development. As it was a small company, there was no operations team. The development team <em>was</em> the operations team. This was no problem for me; installing, maintaining, and configuring Linux was what I really loved to do. And I did a lot of it. We ran all of our internal systems with various flavors of Gentoo Linux. Each of our systems ran a different kernel version, different package libraries, and different configurations. This really taught me a lot about the best development and operational practices.</p>

<h4 id="operations-career">Operations Career</h4>
<p>The engineering company has a sister company, a co-location data center, right next door. The previous Systems Administrator had recently left the position open, and I was graciously offered a chance to come aboard after only a year of working in development. I jumped at the offer. I was given the rare opportunity to join the data center’s staff, and thus began my first operations career. My <em>very</em> first task was to completely tear down and re-build their entire VM cluster on new hypervisors. I cannot <em>begin</em> to tell you how terrifying and exciting this was. I got to BUILD SYSTEMS! Using QEMU, libvirt, and my love for Linux I rebuilt their whole VM cluster on two new hypervisors; learning as I went.</p>

<p>I had no direct senior administrator to bounce ideas off of, and no outside help aside from IRC channels. There was also no developer at the data center, so I was charged with maintaining and building their internal Rails applications as well. Coupled with the various in-house Nagios scripts that checked various hardware around the building using Modbus TCP, I also developed a brand new Rails application, a Sinatra application, and a few trial NodeJS applications. </p>

<p>Learning how to manage and maintain the virtual machine cluster was one of the most fun and rewarding tasks I have ever accomplished at a job site. It was truly a pleasure to dig, discover, rebuild, and then maintain all of our internal VMs. </p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>I hope to continue to enhance all of my skills in operations and administration, especially continuing to work with open source tools, utilities, and operating systems. I am really passionate about learning cloud infrastructure and automating infrastructure with code. I strongly feel that my background in development combined with administration and operations will help me to grow into a well rounded engineer. Just some of the things that I really want to do in the future are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud/Infrastructure Automation</li>
  <li>PaaS</li>
  <li>IaaS</li>
  <li>Virtualization</li>
  <li>Docker / LXC Containers</li>
  <li>Build Systems</li>
  <li>Deliver Seamless Product Throughput </li>
  <li>Learn as much as I can</li>
</ul>

<p>I really feel that culture and community can make or break a company. Some companies have it, some companies claim to have it, and most don’t even know what it is. From what I’ve seen, however, the companies that establish an environment of learning and creating are the most forward thinking and innovative. </p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Growing up I never really had the capital to invest in a home setup, nor were my parents ever going to let me near the networking equipment after capturing packets of web traffic from my parents. Getting my own house for the first time last year and purchasing my own networking equipment opened up a lot of doors for me. I was now able to finally publish something on the public internet that I owned. The only problem with this arose with the financial costs of running bare metal servers at home, and the overhead cost I would need to begin such a project. </p>

<p>I was talking to Brandon Burton (<a href="https://twitter.com/solarce">@solarce</a>) recently and he told me stories of his first stack that he hosted himself. Remembering that I still hadn’t achieved that goal yet, I set out to remedy this problem as quickly as I could. </p>

<p>Owning bare metal servers would still be a costly venture for me today. I would have to pay for the power consumption, the networking equipment to ensure security, and the increased bandwidth of my internet connection. Thus, configuring a VPS would be my best option. </p>

<p>I chose Digital Ocean purely out of simplicity. I could have gone the Amazon AWS route, and still may in the future, but I wanted to start this project ASAP, and was itching to get tinkering with setup. This is my bare and basic write-up of how I migrated my Jekyll blog from a GitHub Pages site to a cloud hosted blog with Digital Ocean. </p>

<h2 id="migrating-my-personal-blog-to-a-digital-ocean-droplet">Migrating my personal blog to a Digital Ocean Droplet</h2>
<p>First things first, I needed to actually create a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> Droplet. Creating a droplet on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> was actually the easiest part of this whole process. I was entirely pleased with the whole setup of my account, the ease of integrating 2-Factor Authentication, and setting up billing via PayPal for my droplet. </p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-digital-ocean-droplet">Setting up a Digital Ocean Droplet</h3>
<p>Once I had a few coins in my Digital Ocean account and my SSH-keys added to my Digital Ocean account, starting a new Digital Ocean droplet couldn’t have been easier. I selected the type of VPS that I wanted, the image I wanted on it, the SSH-Keys I needed, and I was good to go. In 60 seconds I had a working droplet with Ubuntu-14.04 and root access. I was in! </p>

<h3 id="buying-a-domain-name">Buying a Domain Name</h3>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t particularly shop around for the cheapest domain name available, and went with the simpler option of GoDaddy.com. All jokes aside, it was a fairly simple and easy process that allowed me to pay via PayPal for my domain name. $13 bucks and I had grubernaut.com as a domain name. </p>

<h3 id="routing-dns-from-godaddy-to-digital-ocean">Routing DNS from GoDaddy to Digital Ocean</h3>
<p>This…. took me a while. I had to remember that GoDaddy.com was the DNR for the domain, and would need different nameservers specified to point to Digital Ocean. After removing all of the A Records, CNAME Records, and MX Records that GoDaddy.com initializes with, I was left with a bare Zone Record on GoDaddy.com. Aside from the three nameservers provided from Digital Ocean. </p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/vps/nameservers.png" />
  <figcaption>Nameservers from Digital Ocean</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After adding the correct nameservers to GoDaddy.com, I then had to edit my Digital Ocean’s Zone File as well. I needed an A Record that pointed all traffic to my blog, as well as specific trafic for my blog to route correctly. </p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/vps/do-dns1.jpg" />
  <figcaption>DNS on Digital Ocean</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having that all setup, I was now able to ping grubernaut.com, www.grubernaut.com, and blog.grubernaut.com and have them all resolve to my blog droplet’s IP address. </p>

<h3 id="setting-up-continuous-delivery">Setting up Continuous Delivery</h3>
<p>Setting up continuous delivery inside of my droplet was fairly easy since I was using Git as a versioning tool. 
First, I logged into my droplet and created a remote git server. 
Then, I initialized a bare repository, and created a new post-receive hook. (This would be where the continuous delivery comes in!). </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="lineno">1</span> mkdir grubernaut.blog.git
<span class="lineno">2</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>grubernaut.blog.git
<span class="lineno">3</span> git --bare init
<span class="lineno">4</span> touch hooks/post-receive
</code></pre></div>

<p>I opened up the <strong>only</strong> editor there is (ViM) and wrote my post-receive hook. </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="lineno"> 2</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 3</span> <span class="nv">GIT_REPO</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/grubernaut.blog.git
<span class="lineno"> 4</span> <span class="nv">TMP_GIT_CLONE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/tmp/grubernaut.blog
<span class="lineno"> 5</span> <span class="nv">PUBLIC_WWW</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/www/grubernaut.blog
<span class="lineno"> 6</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 7</span> git clone <span class="nv">$GIT_REPO</span> <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span> jekyll build -s <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span> -d <span class="nv">$PUBLIC_WWW</span>
<span class="lineno"> 9</span> rm -Rf <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span> <span class="nb">exit</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This hook would clone my repository into a temporary directory, build my site with jekyll, and place the built site into a public directory. And this hook would run after every commit that was received. </p>

<p>The only thing left to do on my droplet was to configure Apache2 to point to <code>/var/www/grubernaut.blog/</code> and I was all set!</p>

<h3 id="configuring-workstation-repo">Configuring Workstation Repo</h3>
<p>On my development workstation, I had to do some slight configuration to be able to push to my droplet and have it be automagically deployed. Luckily this is just a simple one-line git command. 
<code>bash
git remote add deploy &lt;user&gt;@&lt;site&gt;:~/&lt;path-to-repo&gt;.git
</code>
From there I can now run a <code>git push deploy master</code> and git will take care of the deployment chain for me. </p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts-and-future-plans">Final Thoughts and Future Plans</h3>
<p>Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience for me, and a great introduction to VPS’s. My goal now is to spin up more Droplets on Digital Ocean and start building a full stack of Droplets. 
Things like: </p>

<ul>
  <li>A VPN Server</li>
  <li>A ZNC IRC Bouncer (Something I’ve wanted for a while)</li>
  <li>A Sensu Server to monitor my stack</li>
  <li>etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually I would love to have this whole setup served from Chef cookbooks, and fully automated. This was a great introduction to how the infrastructure in Cloud-Land works though. </p>
