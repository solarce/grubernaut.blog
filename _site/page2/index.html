<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Growing up I never really had the capital to invest in a home setup, nor were my parents ever going to let me near the networking equipment after capturing packets of web traffic from my parents. Getting my own house for the first time last year and purchasing my own networking equipment opened up a lot of doors for me. I was now able to finally publish something on the public internet that I owned. The only problem with this arose with the financial costs of running bare metal servers at home, and the overhead cost I would need to begin such a project. </p>

<p>I was talking to Brandon Burton (<a href="https://twitter.com/solarce">@solarce</a>) recently and he told me stories of his first stack that he hosted himself. Remembering that I still hadn’t achieved that goal yet, I set out to remedy this problem as quickly as I could. </p>

<p>Owning bare metal servers would still be a costly venture for me today. I would have to pay for the power consumption, the networking equipment to ensure security, and the increased bandwidth of my internet connection. Thus, configuring a VPS would be my best option. </p>

<p>I chose Digital Ocean purely out of simplicity. I could have gone the Amazon AWS route, and still may in the future, but I wanted to start this project ASAP, and was itching to get tinkering with setup. This is my bare and basic write-up of how I migrated my Jekyll blog from a GitHub Pages site to a cloud hosted blog with Digital Ocean. </p>

<h2 id="migrating-my-personal-blog-to-a-digital-ocean-droplet">Migrating my personal blog to a Digital Ocean Droplet</h2>
<p>First things first, I needed to actually create a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> Droplet. Creating a droplet on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> was actually the easiest part of this whole process. I was entirely pleased with the whole setup of my account, the ease of integrating 2-Factor Authentication, and setting up billing via PayPal for my droplet. </p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-digital-ocean-droplet">Setting up a Digital Ocean Droplet</h3>
<p>Once I had a few coins in my Digital Ocean account and my SSH-keys added to my Digital Ocean account, starting a new Digital Ocean droplet couldn’t have been easier. I selected the type of VPS that I wanted, the image I wanted on it, the SSH-Keys I needed, and I was good to go. In 60 seconds I had a working droplet with Ubuntu-14.04 and root access. I was in! </p>

<h3 id="buying-a-domain-name">Buying a Domain Name</h3>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t particularly shop around for the cheapest domain name available, and went with the simpler option of GoDaddy.com. All jokes aside, it was a fairly simple and easy process that allowed me to pay via PayPal for my domain name. $13 bucks and I had grubernaut.com as a domain name. </p>

<h3 id="routing-dns-from-godaddy-to-digital-ocean">Routing DNS from GoDaddy to Digital Ocean</h3>
<p>This…. took me a while. I had to remember that GoDaddy.com was the DNR for the domain, and would need different nameservers specified to point to Digital Ocean. After removing all of the A Records, CNAME Records, and MX Records that GoDaddy.com initializes with, I was left with a bare Zone Record on GoDaddy.com. Aside from the three nameservers provided from Digital Ocean. </p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/vps/nameservers.png" />
  <figcaption>Nameservers from Digital Ocean</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After adding the correct nameservers to GoDaddy.com, I then had to edit my Digital Ocean’s Zone File as well. I needed an A Record that pointed all traffic to my blog, as well as specific trafic for my blog to route correctly. </p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/vps/do-dns1.jpg" />
  <figcaption>DNS on Digital Ocean</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having that all setup, I was now able to ping grubernaut.com, www.grubernaut.com, and blog.grubernaut.com and have them all resolve to my blog droplet’s IP address. </p>

<h3 id="setting-up-continuous-delivery">Setting up Continuous Delivery</h3>
<p>Setting up continuous delivery inside of my droplet was fairly easy since I was using Git as a versioning tool. 
First, I logged into my droplet and created a remote git server. 
Then, I initialized a bare repository, and created a new post-receive hook. (This would be where the continuous delivery comes in!). </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="lineno">1</span> mkdir grubernaut.blog.git
<span class="lineno">2</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>grubernaut.blog.git
<span class="lineno">3</span> git --bare init
<span class="lineno">4</span> touch hooks/post-receive
</code></pre></div>

<p>I opened up the <strong>only</strong> editor there is (ViM) and wrote my post-receive hook. </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="lineno"> 2</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 3</span> <span class="nv">GIT_REPO</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/grubernaut.blog.git
<span class="lineno"> 4</span> <span class="nv">TMP_GIT_CLONE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/tmp/grubernaut.blog
<span class="lineno"> 5</span> <span class="nv">PUBLIC_WWW</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/www/grubernaut.blog
<span class="lineno"> 6</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 7</span> git clone <span class="nv">$GIT_REPO</span> <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span> jekyll build -s <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span> -d <span class="nv">$PUBLIC_WWW</span>
<span class="lineno"> 9</span> rm -Rf <span class="nv">$TMP_GIT_CLONE</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span> <span class="nb">exit</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This hook would clone my repository into a temporary directory, build my site with jekyll, and place the built site into a public directory. And this hook would run after every commit that was received. </p>

<p>The only thing left to do on my droplet was to configure Apache2 to point to <code>/var/www/grubernaut.blog/</code> and I was all set!</p>

<h3 id="configuring-workstation-repo">Configuring Workstation Repo</h3>
<p>On my development workstation, I had to do some slight configuration to be able to push to my droplet and have it be automagically deployed. Luckily this is just a simple one-line git command. 
<code>bash
git remote add deploy &lt;user&gt;@&lt;site&gt;:~/&lt;path-to-repo&gt;.git
</code>
From there I can now run a <code>git push deploy master</code> and git will take care of the deployment chain for me. </p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts-and-future-plans">Final Thoughts and Future Plans</h3>
<p>Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience for me, and a great introduction to VPS’s. My goal now is to spin up more Droplets on Digital Ocean and start building a full stack of Droplets. 
Things like: </p>

<ul>
  <li>A VPN Server</li>
  <li>A ZNC IRC Bouncer (Something I’ve wanted for a while)</li>
  <li>A Sensu Server to monitor my stack</li>
  <li>etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually I would love to have this whole setup served from Chef cookbooks, and fully automated. This was a great introduction to how the infrastructure in Cloud-Land works though. </p>

<h2 id="community-interactions-in-devops">Community Interactions in DevOps</h2>
<p>I recently attended <a href="http://devopsdays.org">DevOpsDays</a> <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-pittsburgh/">Pittsburgh </a>, which was my very first conference ever. When I mean first conference ever, I truly mean my very first conference. I’ve never attended a GenCon, ComicCon, E3, or LISA conference in my entire life. And I have got to say that I was completely blown away. Sure, the talks were outstanding, the food was amazing, and the sponsors were giving away a lot of free swag. There was a lot of material to be learned, a lot of people to meet, and a lot of new experiences to take in for a small town kid in Pittsburgh for his first time. But what really made the conference completely life changing for me was the entire community. </p>

<h3 id="heroism-and-pride">Heroism and Pride</h3>
<p>What truly blew me away right off the bat was the lack of heroism and pride from within the community. Here I was, surrounded by extremely talented and legendary people inside of the DevOps community: Mark Imbriaco, Andrew Shafer, Seth Vargo, Dan Buch, Colin Dean, John Vincent, Nathen Harvey, Brian Wagner, Pete Cheslock, and many many others. And yet, there was not a single hint of brash arrogance. My first day I was at the conference I was readily welcomed as if I was already a prominent member of the community. As I was eating my massive piles of bacon for breakfast, I was greeted openly by several other members of the community. No one, I mean no one, ever looked down on me or made me feel inferior and inadequate for being at the conference given my small amount of experience to date. 
This was the first time in my life that I had ever been fully accepted into an academic setting without being judged or assessed.</p>

<p>There was even an excellent talk given by <a href="https://twitter.com/sigje">Jennifer Davis</a> called “From Hero to Zero”. The talk describes how damaging hero’s are to our work environments and to our community. I don’t want to spoil the amazing talk anymore, but you should definitely watch it below when you get a chance. </p>

<h3 id="open-advice-and-understanding">Open Advice and Understanding</h3>
<p>The more and more I networked with the community at DevOpsDays in Pittsburgh, the more and more advice I was given. What I noticed as strange at first yet grew to understand was how all of the advice I was given from several different individuals never contradicted advice I was given from a previous individual. I had truly found a community that cared and gave unbiased advice covering a range of issues. There was no judging on the topics that were brought up. No eye rolling or heavy sighing as if to say, “Oh great, here’s another ‘new guy’…”. </p>

<p>The more and more I talked to various developers and operators alike, the more and more friendly they became. I suddenly realized that everyone at this conference <em>truly</em> cares about the community. Nobody was there trying to make a name for themselves, or trying to one-up the other team. Nobody had a “Linus” mentality about “How things should work”, everybody seemed to contribute equally to the common goal of DevOps. There was hardly (if any) bashing between developers and operators. </p>

<p>I never knew a world like this had existed….</p>

<h3 id="dinner-and-hack-a-social">Dinner and Hack-A-Social</h3>
<p>The last night of the conference I was graciously invited to join a few members of the <a href="http://www.getchef.com">Chef</a> team and Bridget Kromhout (Who is organizing <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-minneapolis/">DevOpsDays Minneapolis</a>). I really got to know the people there at dinner and after talking to Stephen Lauck, Stephen Danna, Julian Dunn, and Bridget. And during dinner we got to talk about a wide variety of topics, including Chef. I was very fortunate to even be present at dinner with them. I mean how many times can someone say that they got to eat dinner with a bunch of Chefs at a restaurant called NaCl (Salt)? </p>

<p>The last day that I was in Pittsburgh, the organizers of the conference rented out space at <a href="http://www.revvoakland.com">Revv Oakland</a>, which was by far <strong>the coolest</strong> experience I have ever had to date. Not only was I able to be more and more involved in the community, but I was able to hack on open source projects <em>with</em> other people in a semi-paired environment. I mean, sure you can hack around on open source projects with people on IRC, but then you always end up with this crap: </p>

<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>I honestly believe that if DevOps is ever going to have a successful future in bringing the development team and the operations team together it will <em>have</em> to be with the kind of respectful patience and tolerance that I witnessed this weekend. I was honestly blown away by the amount of kindness at the conference. This would be the equivalent of putting hardcore VI users in the same room as hardcore EMACS users in the 90’s and watching them be productive. </p>

<p>Actually the only thing bad that I can think of about this weekend was this song that Andrew Shafer and Dan Buch showed me that I cannot get out of my head. </p>
