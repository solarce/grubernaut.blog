## What is Soylent? 
[Soylent](http://soylent.me) is some sort of wicked Brave New World-esque food created by Robert Rhinehart and his team after recognizing the disproportionate amount of time and money they spent creating nutritionally complete meals.

Soylent is a food product (classified as a food, not a supplement, by the FDA) designed for use as a staple meal by all adults. Each serving of Soylent provides maximum nutrition with minimum effort.

## So Why Would I Drink It? 
The main benefit that I saw when researching Soylent was the cost. I would be able to have a whole days worth of food for $3.50 per day. Not only would it be insanely cheap and sustainable, I would be achieving my exact nutritional requirements. 

## Cost? Ingredients? 
I used Soylent's [DIY Tool](http://diy.soylent.me) to select the community favorite recipe called [People's Chow](http://diy.soylent.me/recipes/people-chow-301-tortilla-perfection). With only 8 ingredients (plus water) this seemed like a low-overhead and low-risk entry point into my Soylent experiment. I spent $223 for ~2-3 months worth of food, leaving me with an approximate cost of $3.50/day. The only thing I replaced from the [People's Chow Recipe](http://diy.soylent.me/recipes/people-chow-301-tortilla-perfection) was to substitute Olive Oil for the Soybean Oil.

## Mixing Process
The first time I made the DIY Soylent, I completely messed it up. My blender is too small to blend the whole day's weight of Soylent powder, thus leaving me with an insanely grainy, disgusting, porridge. 
The second time I made the DIY Soylent, I split the weight of the dry ingredients in half, blending half of a days "food" at a time. The steps I found that work best are as follows: 

1. Measure Dry Ingredients
2. Shake Dry Ingredients and add to blender
3. Measure out oil and add to blender
4. Add water to blender 
5. Blend on high for 4+ minutes, then blend on slow for 6+ minutes 
6. Repeat 1-5 for other half of days "food"
7. Refrigerate Soylent overnight 

Using this process I was able to get the best taste out of the DIY Soylent as well as the best consistency of the liquid.

## But does it taste good? 
The first batch of DIY Soylent I made tasted purely horrible. After I split the batch in half and blended it in segments the texture of the Soylent was nearly water. I added 2 Tbsp of Ground Cinnamon along with 3Tbsp of Splenda to each days "food" as well, which seemed to help take away from the bland taste of the Masa. 

## First Day's Report
So far it was fairly easy until right before bedtime to go all day without food. The Soylent is actually fairly filling. After drinking half of a "meal", I actually felt full and satisfied as if I had just eaten a large meal. 
After fixing the taste of the Soylent, I can honestly see this being a viable solution to save money on nutritious food costs.
