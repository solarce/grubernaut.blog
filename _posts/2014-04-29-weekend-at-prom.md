## Prom
This past weekend the girlfriend and I went to the [Columbus Adult Prom](http://www.capadultprom.com) in order to help raise funds for preventing child abuse. 
While, I am far from being a social butterfly, it was a fun "Night on the town" and we were able to get all dressed up for the event.

## Motorcycle

I was even able to talk her into a short ride on the bike this weekend. I'll probably have full tag and more posts to come, fully devoted to the bike later on.

### Wrapup
Overall, it was a fun weekend. Didn't get a whole lot of things done that I wanted to, but that's life. I have a plan written out for implementing a firewall at home for IPv6, and was able to start studying a little for my CCNA exam in July. Didn't do any GO discovery or Emacs discovery, but found SublimeText2 and will probably stick with that for the future.
