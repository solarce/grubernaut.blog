This past week at work I've had the fortunate opportunity to start wiring on our new
Business Continuity Center. The center will end up housing 250+ seats, each with their own
power and network pulls. 

I was surprised at how heavy all 250+ CAT6e cables were, and especially how taxing they
were on our cable trays. Running the wire through the cable trays was easy enough, but
this past week I had the amazing job of combing through our the CAT6e cable and bundling
them into a neat and ordered set. 

## Combing Cable
We purchased our Cable Comb from
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Panduit-CBOT24K-Organizing-Fastener-Inserts/dp/B00429P1OU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398484241&sr=8-1&keywords=panduit+cable+comb)

The Cable Comb was fairly easy to use, however with this much CAT6e cable, there was a lot
of hand work to untagle knots and kinks that the comb was unable to sort through on it's
own.

After combing through the CAT6e cables in our networking closet, I spent the remainder of
the week terminating all of our landings from our wire trays. While it was a nice break
from development and SysAd work, I'm itching to get back to it as soon as our wiring
project is completed.

### Weekend Plans: 

* Final Exams in two weeks. 
* Home Networked IPv6 Firewall 
* CCNA Studying
* GOLang + Emacs discovery

Most of my saturday night will be taken up at [CAP Adult Prom](http://capadultprom.com),
so I hope I can get some fun time to work on some stuff.
