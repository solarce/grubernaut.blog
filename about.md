I grew up on Calvin and Hobbes and an overactive imagination. This is my first attempt at
a landing page / blog, and I'm just going to see how this goes. 

I've been constantly learning and growing since I started using DOS to play Wolfenstein when I was 5. I'm still
in disbelief that I can make a living by doing what I had wanted to do when I was a child,
	but I'm going to keep rocking the dream until I am no longer smart enough to code
	anymore. 

## Things I enjoy:

* Operations Support (SysAd)
* Automation Development and Implementation
* Continuous Integration Tools
* Configuration Management
* Learning new languages and new development strategies.
* C / C++ 
* Ruby 
* Vim (Have been nudged to go emacs)
* Apple Products
* Systems Development (Linux primarily)
* ZSH > BASH
* Riding Motorcycles
* Music. Always playing.
